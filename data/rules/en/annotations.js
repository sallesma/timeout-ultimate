If discussion is difficult due to a language barrier, then gestures or recreations of the incident can be used to indicate what was experienced during the incident (eg striking yourself across the back of the hand to show that your hand was hit as you were trying to catch the disc). Teams may also use a non-player as a translator to assist in communication during a stoppage.
There are times where an event happens where it is not possible to be reasonably certain of exactly what happened (eg no one had a good view, or it happened too quickly). There are also times where it can be difficult to determine whether something ‘affected the play’. In those circumstance the disc should be returned to the last non-disputed thrower.
Discussions should be as brief as possible with the preferred outcome being either a retracted call, or an accepted call. However once it becomes clear that no resolution will be reached, the disc should be returned to the last non-disputed thrower.

If, for example, a player takes a running catch in the end zone, subsequently establishes possession through the first few steps after the catch, and then continues to run as part of a celebration and trips over, any loss of possession that occurs as a result of the celebration would not be deemed to be ‘related to the catch’. One way to distinguish if the contact is related to the catch is that once the player could have chosen to stop moving and be stationary and in control of their movement, any further actions are not related to the catch, even if they do not choose to come to a stop.',

When making a play at a disc, players need to ensure that they will not cause non minor contact with another player (neither their stationary position, nor their expected position based on their established speed and direction), before, during or after the attempt at the disc.
Minor contact is contact that involves minimal physical force and does not alter the movements or position of another player.
If non-minor contact does occur, the result of the play will likely not stand if the breach affected the play.
A breach affects the play if it is reasonable to assume that the outcome of the specific play may have been meaningfully different had the breach not occurred – eg if the player would not have been able to intercept the pass without causing significant contact with their opponent, or the opponent would have been able to make a play at the disc had the player not caused contact with them.
The relative skill, height and/or athletic ability, of the players involved should not typically be taken into account when considering if something affected the play or not`,

A pick should not be called by a defender who was obstructed while attempting to make a play on the disc, that is not related to their ability tomove towards/with the player they are guarding (however a defender may call a violation under Rule 12.7 if applicable).
After an accepted pick call, the picked defender catches up the relative position lost because of the pick. If they were trailing by 2.5 metres, then they get to catch back up to 2.5 metres away, but they do not get to set up right next to the offensive player.`,
