If discussion is difficult due to a language barrier, then gestures or recreations of the incident can be used to indicate what was experienced during the incident (eg striking yourself across the back of the hand to show that your hand was hit as you were trying to catch the disc). Teams may also use a non-player as a translator to assist in communication during a stoppage.
There are times where an event happens where it is not possible to be reasonably certain of exactly what happened (eg no one had a good view, or it happened too quickly). There are also times where it can be difficult to determine whether something ‘affected the play’. In those circumstance the disc should be returned to the last non-disputed thrower.
Discussions should be as brief as possible with the preferred outcome being either a retracted call, or an accepted call. However once it becomes clear that no resolution will be reached, the disc should be returned to the last non-disputed thrower. The suggested maximum length of a stoppage due to a discussion is forty-five (45) seconds). See the Appendix for additional timing rules.`,

When making a play at a disc, players need to ensure that they will not cause non minor contact with another player (neither their stationary position, nor their expected position based on their established speed and direction), before, during or after the attempt at the disc.
Minor contact is contact that involves minimal physical force and does not alter the movements or position of another player.
If non-minor contact does occur, the result of the play will likely not stand if the breach affected the play.
A breach affects the play if it is reasonable to assume that the outcome of the specific play may have been meaningfully different had the breach not occurred – eg if the player would not have been able to intercept the pass without causing significant contact with their opponent, or the opponent would have been able to make a play at the disc had the player not caused contact with them.
The relative skill, height and/or athletic ability, of the players involved should not typically be taken into account when considering if something affected the play or not`,

Non minor contact that occurs directly after the attempt at the disc (i.e. a defender catches the disc and then collides with an offence player) is considered to be a receiving foul. However contact with the opponent’s arms after the block occurs is not a sufficient basis for a foul as per rule 17.2.1.1.
If the disc is in the air but the players involved in the foul were running to receive or defend the next pass after possession has been established, this should be treated as an Indirect foul (rule 17.8).
An accepted offensive receiving foul is a turnover (rule 17.2.2); however an accepted indirect foul by the offence is not (rule 17.8.2).`,
